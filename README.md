# WeatherBar
a non-graphical menu bar item for OSX to display current and forecasted weather conditions

This is Project 10 from the book Hacking with MacOS by Paul Hudson. I have extended functionality by adding current condtions, 12 hour forecast and 7 Day forecast.

Weather data is provided by Dark Sky, which means for this to work on your Mac, you will need a Dark Sky API key (https://darksky.net/dev/) that can be entered in WeatherBar preferences.
